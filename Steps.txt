Step-by-Step Approach

Data Preparation:
	Ensure your dataset includes timestamp information for when orders are placed and their geographical coordinates.
	Preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize features if necessary.

Train a Clustering Model:
	Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to train a model on historical data.

Apply the Model to New Data:
	Use the trained model to predict clusters for new orders.

Group Orders Based on Time Cycles:
	For each time cycle (e.g., every 5 minutes), filter orders that fall within that time frame.
	Apply the clustering model to group these orders based on their locations.
